1. Dynamic Array (C++ vector)

Resizable array
Operations: push, pop, get, set, size
Learn: Dynamic memory, realloc, amortized complexity

2. Singly Linked List (C++ list simplified)

Node-based storage
Operations: insert, delete, search, traverse
Learn: Pointers, node manipulation

3. Stack (C++ stack)

LIFO (Last In First Out)
Can implement using array or linked list
Operations: push, pop, peek, isEmpty
Learn: Two implementation approaches

4. Queue (C++ queue)

FIFO (First In First Out)
Can implement using array (circular) or linked list
Operations: enqueue, dequeue, front, isEmpty
Learn: Circular buffer technique


5. Doubly Linked List (C++ list full version)

Bidirectional traversal
Operations: insert at both ends, delete from anywhere
Learn: Two-way pointers, prev/next management

6. Hash Table (C++ unordered_map)

Key-value storage with O(1) average lookup
Collision handling: chaining or open addressing
Operations: insert, get, delete, contains
Learn: Hash functions, collision resolution

7. Binary Search Tree (BST)

Ordered tree structure
Operations: insert, search, delete, traverse (inorder/preorder/postorder)
Learn: Recursion, tree traversal

8. Hash Set (C++ unordered_set)

Like hash table but only stores keys (no values)
Operations: insert, remove, contains
Learn: Reuse hash table implementation


9. Min Heap / Max Heap (C++ priority_queue)

Binary heap stored in array
Operations: insert, extractMin/Max, peek
Learn: Array-based tree, heapify algorithms

10. Deque (C++ deque)

Double-ended queue (insert/delete from both ends)
Usually implemented as array of arrays
Operations: push_front, push_back, pop_front, pop_back
Learn: Complex array management

11. Balanced BST (C++ set/map)

Self-balancing tree (AVL or Red-Black Tree)
Guarantees O(log n) operations
Learn: Tree rotations, balance factors

12. Graph (Adjacency List / Matrix)

Represents connections between nodes
Two implementations: list or matrix
Learn: Graph traversal (BFS/DFS)


13. Trie (Prefix Tree)

Tree for string storage/search
Used for autocomplete, spell check
Learn: Multi-child nodes

14. Disjoint Set (Union-Find)

Track connected components
Operations: union, find
Learn: Path compression, union by rank
